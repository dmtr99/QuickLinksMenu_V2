This code creates a menu based on a directory, so it is easy to change and manage without changing any code.
It also tries to get the correct Icons based on the extensions of the files.

This script is based on QuickLinks, by Jack Dunning, but with improvements so the level of submenus is unlimited.

Special thanks to @swagfag and @just me to help me translating the DLLCall, NumGet and Numput functions to the V2 version,

This current example has the mapkey Capslock to trigger the menu.# QuickLinksMenu_V2
